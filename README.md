## Getting Started

> **Just want to use the app?** Skip ahead to [Platform-specific Install](#platform-specific-install) — download the right file for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr/releases) and install it. No prerequisites.

### Prerequisites (for building from source)

- Flutter SDK compatible with Dart `^3.10.0` (CI uses Flutter 3.38.7)
- For **iOS / macOS**: Xcode (latest stable)
- For **Android**: Android Studio + Android SDK (compileSdk 36)
- At least one running self-hosted service: Seerr, Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, or qBittorrent

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr.git
cd seekarr
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

---

## Configuration

Seekarr ships with no default credentials. After launching the app, open **Settings** and configure each service you want to use:

- **Seerr** — Base URL + API key
- **Radarr** — Base URL + API key
- **Sonarr** — Base URL + API key
- **Lidarr** — Base URL + API key
- **qBittorrent** — Base URL + Username + Password (uses qB's WebUI v2 form login; no API key)
- Region preferences (where applicable)

API keys are stored securely on the device using `flutter_secure_storage` and are never transmitted outside your local network.

## Platform-specific Install

| Platform | Status | Distribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | ✅ Supported | `.apk` from [Releases](https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr/releases) |
| iOS | ✅ Supported (sideload) | Unsigned `.ipa` from [Releases](https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr/releases) |
| macOS | ✅ Supported | `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr/releases) |
| Web / Linux / Windows | ⚠️ Scaffolding only | Build from source, not officially tested |

### Android

Download the `.apk` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr/releases) page and install it on your device (you may need to allow installs from unknown sources).

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr/releases) page, drag Seekarr to `/Applications`, and launch it. On first run, right-click the app and choose **Open** to bypass Gatekeeper.

### iOS

Download the unsigned `.ipa` from the [Releases](https://github.com/matthw-labs/seekarr/releases) page and sideload it with one of the standard tools:

- **[AltStore](https://altstore.io/)** — refreshes over Wi-Fi on the same machine
- **[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)** — desktop tool, no account needed on macOS
- **[Sideload](https://sideload.app/)** — web-based, runs in your browser

The `.ipa` is **not signed by Apple**, so it has to be installed through one of the tools above (they apply an ad-hoc signature on install). The signature expires and the app needs to be re-installed periodically:

- **Free Apple ID** — 7 days
- **Paid Apple Developer account** — 1 year

<details>
<summary>Build from source</summary>

If you'd rather build the iOS app yourself, clone the repo and run:

```bash
flutter build ios --no-codesign
```

Then open the resulting `.app` in Xcode and run it on your device or simulator.

</details>

### Web, Linux, Windows

Project scaffolding for these platforms exists, but they are **not officially tested or supported**.  
Contributions to improve support on these platforms are welcome.

## Architecture

Seekarr follows a **feature-first layered architecture**:

```

└── features/
    ├── <feature>/
    │   ├── data/         # Services and API calls
    │   ├── domain/       # Models
    │   └── presentation/ # Screens, providers, widgets
    ├── activity/
    ├── discover/
    ├── movies/
    ├── music/
    ├── qbittorrent/
    ├── search/
    ├── series/
    └── settings/
```

**Key technical choices:**

| Concern            | Library                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| UI framework       | Flutter 3.x + Material 3               |
| State management   | Riverpod 3                             |
| Navigation         | go_router 17                           |
| HTTP               | Dio (+ cookie manager for qBittorrent) |
| Image caching      | cached_network_image                   |
| SVG                | flutter_svg                            |
| Dynamic color      | dynamic_color                          |
| Secure storage     | flutter_secure_storage                 |
| Settings storage   | shared_preferences                     |
| Pagination         | infinite_scroll_pagination             |
| URL launching      | url_launcher                           |
| In-app purchase    | in_app_purchase                        |
| File picking       | file_picker                            |

**Goals:** readability, modularity, and reusable UI components built on a consistent design token system (`AppSpacing`, `AppRadius`, `AppAnimation`).

## About this project

Seekarr was born from a personal need: flawlessly managing a self-hosted *arr stack from a phone, from anywhere. It is developed with heavy use of agentic coding tools (OpenCode + LLMs), with a focus on pushing AI-assisted development to its quality limits — not just shipping fast.
